                    <p>This project was an assignment in a course I took. My instructor based the project on a 99design contest. The 99design website is where clients and web developers can connect based on the need of the project. This project was for this company who has houses for rent across the country. There were some specific design and content items that the company gave with the 99design description to be on the home page. My instructor also added some requirements, including utilizing Bootstrap, cards, carousels, special list designs and other design elements using Bootstrap. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Rent Own Homes Pro is dedicated to helping people in any financial situation to be in a position where they can own a home through renting with them. Their target audience is people who want to own their own home, but do not have the established credit yet to buy a home on a mortgage.

                    <div class="section-underline bg-primary mb-3"></div>
                    <p>The goal of this project is to make a modern, clean, and attractive website. Creating a modern website will include things like customized color scheme, fonts, parallax scrolling, responsive sizing, and clean information cards. The cards must be well designed to make people interested in the home and able to find the information they are looking for quickly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The scope consisted of creating just the front-end of the homepage, meaning there will be limited working buttons and pages. Forms will also not work, and data is not dynamic. This site was built to purely showcase design. 
                    </p>

                            <p>I was only given a few images of homes for the selling cards, a few reviews, and the logo. I added icons from Font Awesome, Flat Icons, and images from Unsplash and Pixabay. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The site was created using HTML5, SASS, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.5, and Photoshop

                        The first thing I did after looking at the logo that I was given, was take the color of the green from the logo. With the green color I started looking at coolors.co and experimented with color schemes that would go well with the green, but the green would be more of an accent color. I picked a few color schemes I thought would go well with the logo, and then set out to find the perfect hero image. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After I found the image I wanted as my hero background, I matched the colors of the picture to one of the color schemes I liked. This worked well and created a harmonious color scheme that conveyed a modern and clean look from the first appearance.

                        I chose two sans-serif fonts for the site. I chose Catamaran for the heading font because I thought it really made it look modern, while still giving a slightly soft tone. I chose the Merriweather Sans Light to really give the paragraph and content text a contrast in weight. Even when it is a light weight, it is still easily read on mobile and small screens. The use of these fonts really contributed to the overall modern feel of the design.

                        I customized Bootstrap using CSS and SCSS to create custom interface elements. This included cards, buttons, icons, and carousel work for the reviews.                     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These styles really made certain elements pop and overall united the look and feel of the entire site. This was achieved by using similar style icons, consistent colors, and careful use of white space.

                        Made the top navigation bar sticky, and appear transparent until you start scrolling. This allows the real estate of the hero image to be at the maximum. I included this because it gave the site a nice, modern touch. It works on both desktop and mobile, creating a unified and effective experience.

                        Created the responsive form to sit horizontally in desktop, and to be a pop up on mobile. I chose to do this to save on the real estate of the screen on mobile. I think the button was effective in grabbing attention, and the form popping up is a simple solution to not endangering the hero image.

                        Designed a list to be unlike most lists, so it would be interesting for the user to read. There were eight steps, so I thought having them across the screen like this would be a modern, yet creative use of space. The numbers are custom designed and positioned.

                        I did not complete this project without some challenges that came up. I spent a lot of time trying to make the landing screen to look better in the mobile view. It wasn’t until very late in the project I had the idea to put the mobile form in a modal, and that made all the difference. This cleared up the cluttered appearance of the form on mobile, but allowed it to be present on desktop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had some challenges with the custom list section that presented eight pieces of information. Customizing the list to appear like that took a lot of CSS trickery and positioning. Making that section responsive was also quite challenging, but using media queries and custom CSS more than the built in Bootstrap classes allowed me to have greater control of that section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other section that was particularly challenging would be the testimonial section. This section was very difficult to make responsive. This was solved by careful media queries and several drafts of designs. I ended up with this design to incorporate more of a visual effect with the rounded images and the text almost wrapping around it.

                    <p>There were a lot of things that I learned during this project. I utilized Bootstrap 4.5 classes more than I ever have before and tried to be creative while maintaining a modern, clean look and feel. I think this site represents the company’s values of helping people, and conveys a great message to the user of the credibility of the company. I really enjoyed doing this design and implementation using Bootstrap and SCSS to create something that is beautiful, effective,  and creative. </p>
