                    <p>I had the opportunity to showcase one of the most well-beloved figures in all of history, Santa Claus. Santa Eric is a famous Santa throughout the Wasatch front. He is the Santa for the Hogle Zoo, Megaplex Theatres, Layton City, and various company, church, and family parties. His calendar is often booked well in advance of the Christmas season (we are talking June), but he still makes time to see his neighbors and volunteers for free for families and charity organizations who cannot pay. This Santa Claus truly is jolly and loves his profession.

                    <div class="section-underline bg-primary mb-3"></div>
                    <p>
                        Making a website for this type of person is a delight. His goals were to convey professionalism, simplicity, and most of all that Santa joy we all love and know! I had previously designed Santa Eric’s business card a few years prior to the site, and we used the card to establish the mood and theme we wanted to convey to the users on the website.

                    <p>
                        The time to complete this project was about four weeks from design to production. The finished production product is a Wix site that was built to showcase the design. A more fully customizable site is under construction. The updated site will be created using Vue.js and Bootstrap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The target audience was intended for professionals looking to book a Santa for their family, community, or corporate party. Its main focus was to allow users to see his current bookings, and provide a way to contact Santa Eric (or one of his helpers) for scheduling needs.

                                This site was made in Wix, an online drag and drop website creator. It is currently being transformed into a completely customized site built in Vue.js utilizing Bootstrap, so I can be in complete control. Wix was used as a starter to see where we wanted to take the site, or if the client actually wanted the website in production.

                        The first step was to dedicate time to create a user persona. This involved establishing common demographics of Santa Eric’s clients. We researched what would be most effective in terms of who the target audience would be, and created a user persona to highlight the findings.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="number-text pb-4">
                    <p>
                        The mood board conveyed the tone and mood that the client wanted to achieve. It also established the font sizes, font family, colors, and some example images. I chose the Lato font family because of its clean, modern, professional look.  I thought the sans serif look would provide a striking comparison to the serif font found in the logo. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The colors were easier to choose than most sites, because the client is Santa! We went with a deeper red tone with grey, with minimal highlight accents of a muted green. We wanted to avoid the bright red and green scheme because we felt it would date the site.

                        After the initial content and mood were decided upon, the next step was to decide the wording of the navigation and which pages made sense to users. I performed several tests on users to see which organization made the most sense. This specific card sorting test was given in a paper format. I believe that quality user experience only comes when you involve actual users in your design and organization process

                        A wireframe was first completed with pure layout in mind. User testing was also implemented at this stage to ensure the site would be designed with the user in mind. The wireframe was completed in Adobe XD, with a mobile and desktop view available.

                        After thought was given to the results of the wireframe, I then did a mockup of the site. I used Adobe XD for this as well. This added more content, colors, fonts, and images to the site. After I did that and evaluated feedback, I proceeded to make the mockup into a prototype. The prototype was built in AdobeXD, and allowed users to click buttons to take them to certain pages
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allowed me to conduct several screen recorded tests. I asked a user to do a specific test and recorded where they had trouble completing that task to find out where the design wasn’t intuitive enough. I repeated this test on mobile and desktop versions of the prototype with a group of people. The findings were clear that some of these processes weren’t as clear as I had thought, and adjustments to the design and layout were made.

                        The coding for this site was very minimal because I used Wix.com to create the site. This was done so it could be published quickly and the client could test it out before committing to a more custom site. The new site is currently under-construction. There was complete customization done to the wix site and some CSS and HTML were added to make it appear more like the final prototype.

                        The end result was a beautiful website. Although it has some responsive issues due to Wix, it is a functional site that Santa Eric was thrilled to see the complete result.

                        There were a lot of things I learned about effective design process and user testing during this process. This is the first project I worked closely with the client and users on. This process opened my eyes to the fact that even if it makes sense to me, it may not to another person. There are certain steps in the design process of any website or program that are often overlooked - user testing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I feel like one of the hardest, yet most rewarding, parts of this project were sitting down with users and watching them struggle to navigate a site that was so simple in my mind. Learning what would be best of the user enabled me to make good design decisions, both aesthetically and in a pure navigational sense. Although changing layouts and patterns so much was tedious for me, it made the finished product hardly need any refinement when it comes to user friendliness. This project taught me a lot, which has spilled over into other projects that are now more heavily based on sound user experience principles.
